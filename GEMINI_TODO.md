# GEMINI's Proposal for New Planetiler Themes

This document outlines three ambitious and critical new map themes proposed by Gemini 2.5 Pro. These themes are designed to address contemporary and future global challenges, moving beyond simple data visualization to become interactive atlases for policymakers, researchers, and the general public.

### 1. Climate Change Impacts & Adaptation

**Philosophy:**
While the existing `energy_transition` theme focuses on climate change "mitigation," this theme is dedicated to visualizing the "impacts" of ongoing and future climate change and humanity's "adaptation" measures. It aims to transform the abstract concept of climate change into tangible, geographic risks, supporting the construction of a more resilient society.

**Key Data Layers:**
*   **Sea Level Rise Scenarios:** Inundation zones for +1m, +2m, and +5m sea-level rise, based on IPCC forecast data.
*   **Extreme Weather Risks:**
    *   **Heatwaves:** Areas with a projected increase in the annual number of extreme heat days (e.g., >40°C).
    *   **Drought & Water Scarcity:** An evolution of the `water_stress` theme, showing future high-risk areas for water resource depletion.
    *   **Wildfires:** High-risk wildfire zones based on vegetation and climate models.
*   **Ecosystem Shifts:** Coral bleaching risk areas, permafrost thaw zones, and projected changes in vegetation distribution.
*   **Adaptation Infrastructure:** Locations of constructed sea walls, green infrastructure (urban parks, retention basins), and agricultural transition support zones (e.g., areas introducing drought-resistant crops).

**Potential Data Sources:**
*   IPCC, NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), public data from national environmental agencies, World Resources Institute (WRI), simulation results from specialized research institutions.

**Expected Impact:**
*   Enabling urban planners to design infrastructure projects considering future inundation risks.
*   Assisting farmers in selecting future-appropriate crops for their region.
*   Allowing citizens to intuitively understand the climate risks facing their communities and enhance their disaster preparedness.

### 2. Global Food Systems & Land Use

**Philosophy:**
The food system that supports 8 billion people is one of the most critical activities shaping global land use. This theme visualizes "where" and "how" the world's food is produced and its connection to deforestation and water resources. It provides a foundation for understanding the trade-offs between food security and sustainable land use.

**Key Data Layers:**
*   **Major Crop Zones:** Cultivation areas for major crops like wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans, with yield data where possible.
*   **Livestock Distribution:** Density of major livestock such as cattle, pigs, and poultry.
*   **Land-Use Change:**
    *   **Deforestation for Agriculture:** Areas converted from forest to farmland over the past 20 years.
    *   **Farmland Loss to Urbanization:** Prime agricultural land lost to urban expansion.
*   **Food Insecurity Hotspots:** Regions identified by organizations like the UN WFP as being at high risk of food insecurity or famine.
*   **Supply Chains:** Major food import/export routes (ports, shipping lanes).

**Potential Data Sources:**
*   FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture), Copernicus Global Land Service, Global Forest Watch, national ministries of agriculture.

**Expected Impact:**
*   Helping food companies assess deforestation risks in their supply chains and formulate sustainable sourcing policies.
*   Informing policymakers in designing agricultural policies that balance food self-sufficiency with environmental impact.
*   Allowing consumers to understand the origins of their food and its environmental context.

### 3. Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Lands

**Philosophy:**
Human prosperity is derived not just from economies and infrastructure, but also from diverse cultures and histories. This theme maps and promotes the protection and respect for our shared cultural heritage—threatened by physical destruction, climate change, and economic development—and the indigenous lands that are key to ecosystem preservation. This is an atlas for humanity.

**Key Data Layers:**
*   **World Heritage & Intangible Cultural Heritage:** UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites (Cultural, Natural, Mixed) and their buffer zones.
*   **Heritage in Danger:** Sites at risk of destruction from conflict or disaster.
*   **Recognized Indigenous Territories:** Lands and territories traditionally managed or used by the world's indigenous peoples.
*   **Endangered Languages:** Regions where critically endangered languages are spoken.
*   **Archaeological Sites:** Locations of major archaeological discoveries.

**Potential Data Sources:**
*   UNESCO, ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites), IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), indigenous rights organizations, linguistic databases (e.g., Ethnologue).

**Expected Impact:**
*   Enabling development projects to pre-assess impacts on cultural heritage and indigenous lands and modify plans accordingly.
*   Serving as an educational tool for teachers to connect geography, history, and culture.
*   Encouraging travelers to deepen their understanding of the cultural significance of the places they visit and practice responsible tourism.
